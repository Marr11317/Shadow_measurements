This little tool helps visualize shadows on a land.

In my case, a school wanted to build a huge (6 stories) building right besides our house, so I wanted to evaluate the impact of having 4 to 6 stories.

These images are for february 20th, 2022:

4 stories:

5 stories:

6 stories

## Usage:

1) Clone the example `git clone ...`
2) install the dependencies `pnpm install`
3) Run the example `pnpm dev`
4) Tweak the buildings and lands in Constructions.Ts

You can use Controller.ts (uncomment in main.ts) to generate multiple pictures of your setup.

At any point, press 'e' to take a screenshot and save it to your downloads.
